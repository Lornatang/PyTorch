PyTorch: Defining New autograd Functions
----------------------------------------

A fully-connected ReLU network with one hidden layer and no biases, trained to
predict y from x by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.

This implementation computes the forward pass using operations on PyTorch
Variables, and uses PyTorch autograd to compute gradients.

In this implementation we implement our own custom autograd function to perform
the ReLU function.
